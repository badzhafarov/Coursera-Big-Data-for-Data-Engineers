The dataset represents the data about trees which were planted in the US (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype). The dataset consists of the information about 500000 trees. Your aim is to build Random Forest Ensemble to predict the cover type of trees. In order to successfully complete this assignment you have to follow this algorithm:

* Load the training data
* Transform categorical features into vector representations
* Split the dataset into the train and validation part
* Fit the Random Forest Ensemble on the training set
