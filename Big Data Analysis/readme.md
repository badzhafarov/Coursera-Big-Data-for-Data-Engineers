  * [Music Recommender 1](https://github.com/badzhafarov/Coursera-Big-Data-for-Data-Engineers/blob/master/Big%20Data%20Analysis/recommender1.ipynb) - build the edges of the type “track-track”. To do it you will need to count the collaborative similarity between all the tracks: if a user has started listening to track B within 7 minutes after starting track A, then you should add 1 to the weight of the edge from vertex A to vertex B (initial weight is equal to 0).
